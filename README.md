# project01_simon

Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript (with use of jQuery library)


Approach taken:

The goal was to make a spin-off of the classic game, Simon, and add a DC Metro theme.  The basic setup and rules of the original game were observed and used in the initial set-up of this game.  After the initial Javascript logic did not prove to be accurate and sustainable, sessions with the instructors led to working game script.  Once that was established, focus shifted to creating a dynamic score-keeping board to add to the overall look and feel of the game.


Installation instructions:

None.


Unsolved problems:

The code could use a lot of clean-up and restructuring to make it condensed and DRY.  More playtesting is needed to locate and address unusual scenarios and limit the events that can occur once game ends.  A method of score-keeping across page refreshes can be explored.  Currently if the player clicks too fast, the sounds can get thrown off.


User Stories:

1.  As a user, I should be able to control when the game starts so that I can play when I'm ready.
2.  As a user, I should be able to choose the level of difficulty so that I can feel challenged.
3.  As a user, I should be able to know if I made the correct game moves so that I know if I should keep playing.
4.  As a user, I should be able to play the game using either a mouseclick or a key press.
5.  As a user, I should be able to visualize how close I am to winning the level.
