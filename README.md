# project01_simon


Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript (with use of jQuery library)


Approach taken:

The goal was to create a spin-off of the classic memory game, Simon, with a DC Metro theme.  The basic rules and setup were observed in the inital set up of the game, then liberties were taken to fit the new game theme.  A dynamic score-keeping board was created to add to the basic look and feel of the game.


Installation instructions:

None.


Unsolved problems:

Game logic needs to be improved so game restarts smoothly without refreshing the page.  The code needs cleanup and restructuring to keep it condensed and DRY.  More playtesting needs to be conducted and unusual scenarios need to be investigated.  


User Stories:

1.  As a user, I should be able to control when the game starts so that I can play when I'm ready.
2.  As a user, I should be able to choose the level of difficulty so that I can feel challenged.
3.  As a user, I should be able to know if I made the correct game moves so that I know if I should keep playing.
4.  As a user, I should be able to play the game using either a mouseclick or a key press.
5.  As a user, I should be able to visualize how close I am to winning the level.
