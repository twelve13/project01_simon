# project01_simon

Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript (with jQuery library)


Approach Taken:

The goal was to create a spin-off of the classic game, Simon, with a DC Metro theme.  The basic rules and setup were observed in the inital set up of the game, then liberties were taken to fit the new game theme.  Once the original Javascript game logic proved to be faulty, sessions with the instructors led to a working script.  Next, a dynamic score-keeping board was created to add to the basic look and feel of the game.


Installation Instructions:

None.

Unsolved Problems:

The code needs cleanup and restructuring to keep it condensed and DRY.  More playtesting needs to be conducted and unusual scenarios need to be investigated.  Currently, if the user clicks too fast, it can interfere with the sounds.

User Stories:

1.  As a user, I should be able to control when to start the game, so that I am prepared to play the game.
2.  As a user, I should be able to choose the level of difficulty, so that I can opt to be challenged.
3.  As a user, I should be able to play using either a mouse click or key press, so that I can have options for how to play.
4.  As a user, I should be able to know if I made a correct game move, so that I know whether or not to keep playing.
5.  As a user, I should be able to determine how close I am to winning the level.
